Our community is hurt and we are hurting with them.  As we silently watched our beloved Bolé went up in flames, it was heartbreaking to witness, what we all considered our home, reduced to ashes. What is positive? It is witnessing the overwhelming messages and well wishes that Solomon, Rekik, and the Bolé staff have received.  And we thank you, on behalf of the entire family for standing with us when everything else seems like it has fallen beneath our feet. It is comforting to know that we are not alone in thinking that Bolé was not just a restaurant for us, Bolé was the pillar of the community. Bolé was our home away from home. Because your feedback to this unspeakable misfortune is to rise up, to rebuild, and to become the Bolé you all are accustomed to. And with your unyielding support, we are confident will have you dining at your clean tables in no time. As you might have also known, the irreplaceable damage was not only caused to Bolé restaurant. Bolé Express, the fast food version of the Bolé franchise, due to open on Sunday, May 31st, 2020 was also burned to the ground. Solomon and the entire crew spent the last 8 months building Bolé Express and they are incredibly proud of the vision to offer an alternative to our busy customers by grabbing their meals with a 2-minute turn around service. From the start, Bolé was a community driven business, this misfortune has taught all of us that community is what we all have when everything else is stripped away. Therefore, upon the overwhelming request by many of you, we have set up this platform so that you can donate for the initiation of the ‘Re-building Bolé’ project as you see fit. THANK YOU AND PLEASE CONTINUE TO KEEP THE BOLÉ FAMILY IN YOUR PRAYERS.- Family and Friends Additional information:  About the restaurant owners:Solomon and Rekik are active members of their community and they used Ethiopian food to connect people from all over the world.  They have two beautiful children.  While the situation has hit the family hard, they are not the type to lose hope.  About the organizers: The GoFundme account was created at the request of family members of Solomon and Rekik and community partners including Zehabesha (Henok Degfu), Dr. Sirak Hailu, and many other local supporters. My name is Lelna and I have had the privilege to work with Solomon and Rekik to strategize, build &amp; expand their business over the past 2 years in St. Paul, Minnesota. They are extremely hard-working individuals that are ready to get back to work. Bole as a whole was a family to many, including all the employees. In our best interests to support them during this difficult time, the community has come together to rebuild Bole. Our goal is to use the funds to build Bole - a restaurant that was a home away from home for many and a place of security and employment for the staff. The money raised will go directly to the Bole business owners via their business account where the owners will use it to start building a new business. In their own words - \"We want to build something that the community can be proud of and will call it their own.\"","desc":"George Floyd's life mattered!

After months of grueling planning, we managed to safely reopen our doors to serve our community and restore our teams’ lost jobs. On Sunday May 31st, only two weeks after reopening, waves of brazen rioters and looters destroyed all that our team has built since 1985. Previously the office of Dr. Weintraub, we have always endeavored to provide superior eye care and deliver a bespoke experience. Dr. Sun, Dr. Sjolund, and the team have invested countless hours to nurture a unique patient experience, and regretfully must inform all patients that Sunny Optometry must again close until further notice to repair the extensive vandalism. We want the community to know that every member of the Sunny Optometry team is from a minority group. We are Asian, Black, Hispanic, and 90% women operated. We are your neighbors, friends, and family. On the eve of our 1 year anniversary from transitioning from Dr. Weintraub to Sunny Optometry, our hopes and dreams were crushed by having to close our doors for the second time in 2020.Dr. Sun is a first generation immigrant who spent every single summer, winter, and spring break working to help financially support her family. She grew up with the impression that American dream could be achieved through diligence and education, and became an optometrist. She met her husband Dr. Sjolund in optometry school, and together they poured their heart, soul, and life savings into their practice.Amid the start of a protest in downtown Santa Monica, all day we helplessly witnessed our life’s work vandalized, stolen, and burned. The looters were so thorough they stole everything including receipt paper, pennies, and lint in our drawers before setting it all ablaze. We are eternally grateful for the brave police and firefighters who managed to mitigate the damage and prevent the office from becoming a pile of ash. Sunny Optometry is independently owned, and our team greatly appreciates any assistance as we try to rebuild during these unprecedented times.

I am trying to raise money for my uncle's (Jose Tamay) business - El Sabor Chuchi . Last night during the Lake Street riots following the murder of George Floyd, his business was vandalized, and three large store windows were shattered and his store was looted. This isn’t the first time that Jose’s business has been broken into, his store was robbed and looted just a few weeks ago while shut down due to COVID-19. See news story below:News Story Also, last year in June, Jose hired someone to install a new exhaust hood in his restaurant location, but the man who was to install it, disappeared. Jose lost $15,000 cash. Jose sued, he won the court case, but almost a year has passed and he hasn’t received any money.Jose is a really hard working man who works 7 days a week, 13 hours a day, from 8am to 9pm. He does everything he can to provide for his wife and two kids. Being an immigrant, Jose doesn’t have access to bank loans or stimulus money. All the money used to create his business was saved from working long hours as a cook/dishwasher.Raising money for Jose is important to me because he has worked so hard to create two small, successful businesses and always has a positive attitude despite many setbacks. He is such an inspiring and amazing person, and it's really hard to see him get knocked down so many times.As a part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) education track I am enrolling in, community involvement is an important part of my education. I am particularly passionate about the plight of immigrants. Through this fundraiser, I hope to spread awareness of how much immigrants are both directly and indirectly targeted and taken advantage of. Please help me show kindness to some of our city’s most vulnerable citizens.Your donation will go directly to Jose and his family to help replace three broken storefront windows and to recoup a portion of his losses. In addition, your financial support will provide a much needed sense of security and community to this family. Please share with your friends and family even if you are unable to donate.","desc":"My name is Javier Tamay, and I am a Junior at Great River School in St. P","region":"MN","shared_count":1507,"campaign_state":"active","user":"Javier Tamay","index":26},{"source":"gfm","image":"https://images.gofundme.com/uiTd1Pz3vXUgP2co0McUV-11rXo=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48457258_1591029069245794_r.jpeg","hearts":5619,"launched":"2020-06-01T11:34:41-05:00","current":101058,"deactivated":false,"donations":5624,"donations_enabled":true,"goal":100000,"name":"Zahalea Anderson","id":"zahalea-anderson","longDesc":"Zahalea Anderson/ Zahalea Showe lost her business in Long Beach, California yesterday. 25 years in this building running her School of Self Defense, and now it’s been lost to the only fire in Long Beach.
