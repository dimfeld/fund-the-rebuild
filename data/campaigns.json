Our community is hurt and we are hurting with them.  As we silently watched our beloved Bolé went up in flames, it was heartbreaking to witness, what we all considered our home, reduced to ashes. What is positive? It is witnessing the overwhelming messages and well wishes that Solomon, Rekik, and the Bolé staff have received.  And we thank you, on behalf of the entire family for standing with us when everything else seems like it has fallen beneath our feet. It is comforting to know that we are not alone in thinking that Bolé was not just a restaurant for us, Bolé was the pillar of the community. Bolé was our home away from home. Because your feedback to this unspeakable misfortune is to rise up, to rebuild, and to become the Bolé you all are accustomed to. And with your unyielding support, we are confident will have you dining at your clean tables in no time. As you might have also known, the irreplaceable damage was not only caused to Bolé restaurant. Bolé Express, the fast food version of the Bolé franchise, due to open on Sunday, May 31st, 2020 was also burned to the ground. Solomon and the entire crew spent the last 8 months building Bolé Express and they are incredibly proud of the vision to offer an alternative to our busy customers by grabbing their meals with a 2-minute turn around service. From the start, Bolé was a community driven business, this misfortune has taught all of us that community is what we all have when everything else is stripped away. Therefore, upon the overwhelming request by many of you, we have set up this platform so that you can donate for the initiation of the ‘Re-building Bolé’ project as you see fit. THANK YOU AND PLEASE CONTINUE TO KEEP THE BOLÉ FAMILY IN YOUR PRAYERS.- Family and Friends Additional information:  About the restaurant owners:Solomon and Rekik are active members of their community and they used Ethiopian food to connect people from all over the world.  They have two beautiful children.  While the situation has hit the family hard, they are not the type to lose hope.  About the organizers: The GoFundme account was created at the request of family members of Solomon and Rekik and community partners including Zehabesha (Henok Degfu), Dr. Sirak Hailu, and many other local supporters. My name is Lelna and I have had the privilege to work with Solomon and Rekik to strategize, build &amp; expand their business over the past 2 years in St. Paul, Minnesota. They are extremely hard-working individuals that are ready to get back to work. Bole as a whole was a family to many, including all the employees. In our best interests to support them during this difficult time, the community has come together to rebuild Bole. Our goal is to use the funds to build Bole - a restaurant that was a home away from home for many and a place of security and employment for the staff. The money raised will go directly to the Bole business owners via their business account where the owners will use it to start building a new business. In their own words - \"We want to build something that the community can be proud of and will call it their own.\"","desc":"George Floyd's life mattered!
