Our community is hurt and we are hurting with them.  As we silently watched our beloved Bolé went up in flames, it was heartbreaking to witness, what we all considered our home, reduced to ashes. What is positive? It is witnessing the overwhelming messages and well wishes that Solomon, Rekik, and the Bolé staff have received.  And we thank you, on behalf of the entire family for standing with us when everything else seems like it has fallen beneath our feet. It is comforting to know that we are not alone in thinking that Bolé was not just a restaurant for us, Bolé was the pillar of the community. Bolé was our home away from home. Because your feedback to this unspeakable misfortune is to rise up, to rebuild, and to become the Bolé you all are accustomed to. And with your unyielding support, we are confident will have you dining at your clean tables in no time. As you might have also known, the irreplaceable damage was not only caused to Bolé restaurant. Bolé Express, the fast food version of the Bolé franchise, due to open on Sunday, May 31st, 2020 was also burned to the ground. Solomon and the entire crew spent the last 8 months building Bolé Express and they are incredibly proud of the vision to offer an alternative to our busy customers by grabbing their meals with a 2-minute turn around service. From the start, Bolé was a community driven business, this misfortune has taught all of us that community is what we all have when everything else is stripped away. Therefore, upon the overwhelming request by many of you, we have set up this platform so that you can donate for the initiation of the ‘Re-building Bolé’ project as you see fit. THANK YOU AND PLEASE CONTINUE TO KEEP THE BOLÉ FAMILY IN YOUR PRAYERS.- Family and Friends Additional information:  About the restaurant owners:Solomon and Rekik are active members of their community and they used Ethiopian food to connect people from all over the world.  They have two beautiful children.  While the situation has hit the family hard, they are not the type to lose hope.  About the organizers: The GoFundme account was created at the request of family members of Solomon and Rekik and community partners including Zehabesha (Henok Degfu), Dr. Sirak Hailu, and many other local supporters. My name is Lelna and I have had the privilege to work with Solomon and Rekik to strategize, build &amp; expand their business over the past 2 years in St. Paul, Minnesota. They are extremely hard-working individuals that are ready to get back to work. Bole as a whole was a family to many, including all the employees. In our best interests to support them during this difficult time, the community has come together to rebuild Bole. Our goal is to use the funds to build Bole - a restaurant that was a home away from home for many and a place of security and employment for the staff. The money raised will go directly to the Bole business owners via their business account where the owners will use it to start building a new business. In their own words - \"We want to build something that the community can be proud of and will call it their own.\"","desc":"George Floyd's life mattered!

I am trying to raise money for my uncle's (Jose Tamay) business - El Sabor Chuchi . Last night during the Lake Street riots following the murder of George Floyd, his business was vandalized, and three large store windows were shattered and his store was looted. This isn’t the first time that Jose’s business has been broken into, his store was robbed and looted just a few weeks ago while shut down due to COVID-19. See news story below:News Story Also, last year in June, Jose hired someone to install a new exhaust hood in his restaurant location, but the man who was to install it, disappeared. Jose lost $15,000 cash. Jose sued, he won the court case, but almost a year has passed and he hasn’t received any money.Jose is a really hard working man who works 7 days a week, 13 hours a day, from 8am to 9pm. He does everything he can to provide for his wife and two kids. Being an immigrant, Jose doesn’t have access to bank loans or stimulus money. All the money used to create his business was saved from working long hours as a cook/dishwasher.Raising money for Jose is important to me because he has worked so hard to create two small, successful businesses and always has a positive attitude despite many setbacks. He is such an inspiring and amazing person, and it's really hard to see him get knocked down so many times.As a part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) education track I am enrolling in, community involvement is an important part of my education. I am particularly passionate about the plight of immigrants. Through this fundraiser, I hope to spread awareness of how much immigrants are both directly and indirectly targeted and taken advantage of. Please help me show kindness to some of our city’s most vulnerable citizens.Your donation will go directly to Jose and his family to help replace three broken storefront windows and to recoup a portion of his losses.

After months of grueling planning, we managed to safely reopen our doors to serve our community and restore our teams’ lost jobs. On Sunday May 31st, only two weeks after reopening, waves of brazen rioters and looters destroyed all that our team has built since 1985. Previously the office of Dr. Weintraub, we have always endeavored to provide superior eye care and deliver a bespoke experience. Dr. Sun, Dr. Sjolund, and the team have invested countless hours to nurture a unique patient experience, and regretfully must inform all patients that Sunny Optometry must again close until further notice to repair the extensive vandalism. We want the community to know that every member of the Sunny Optometry team is from a minority group. We are Asian, Black, Hispanic, and 90% women operated. We are your neighbors, friends, and family. On the eve of our 1 year anniversary from transitioning from Dr. Weintraub to Sunny Optometry, our hopes and dreams were crushed by having to close our doors for the second time in 2020.Dr. Sun is a first generation immigrant who spent every single summer, winter, and spring break working to help financially support her family. She grew up with the impression that American dream could be achieved through diligence and education, and became an optometrist. She met her husband Dr. Sjolund in optometry school, and together they poured their heart, soul, and life savings into their practice.Amid the start of a protest in downtown Santa Monica, all day we helplessly witnessed our life’s work vandalized, stolen, and burned. The looters were so thorough they stole everything including receipt paper, pennies, and lint in our drawers before setting it all ablaze. We are eternally grateful for the brave police and firefighters who managed to mitigate the damage and prevent the office from becoming a pile of ash. Sunny Optometry is independently owned, and our team greatly appreciates any assistance as we try to rebuild during these unprecedented times.

We were all disgusted and heartbroken by this event as it played out over social media and news outlets everywhere.  Within hours the citizens of that area took to the streets in protest. A few days later that protest turned into violence, looting, and arson.  Bre Lenton, a Salon Manager was living in the heart of the riots on the second floor of an apartment building.  Beneath her were the shops and stores that we all watched as looters picked them apart.  Early into Thursday morning, the looting turned into arson. These rioters armed with crowbars, first broke into her building attempting to take everything in it. Bre, with her fellow tenants literally fought them off pushing them out of the doorway. Shortly after not being able to gain access to the apartment, and after emptying the stores below the building of everything, the rioters had only one destructive thing left that they could do. They lit the building on fire.  Bre could only watch in horror as the home she had just moved into a week prior and literally everything she owned was about to be taken from her.  Fearing for her life, she grabbed her two cats and fled for their lives. Thankfully she was able to reach her car and escape the area alive. Due to the Pandemic, Bre, like so many others has been laid off for 2 months. Just two days after she returned to works Bre, a single mother, great friend, and an amazing human is about to start over. Upon returning to her apartment this May 28th morning she was able to save most of her things although there is smoke damage and virtually every door has been smashed in and broken down by looters, her home is not inhabitable.  I am asking anyone who can to help donate so she can try to rebuild her life and find a new place to live.","desc":"I am sure everyone in the world has now heard about or seen the video of a Minneapolis","region":"MN","shared_count":2653,"campaign_state":"active","user":"Randy Herreid","index":29},{"source":"gfm","image":"https://images.gofundme.com/1-BcMRRCCrw3nqtO8t7aEMECwu8=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48395280_1590787495875169_r.jpeg","hearts":293,"launched":"2020-05-29T16:07:51-05:00","current":12453,"deactivated":false,"donations":292,"donations_enabled":true,"goal":20000,"name":"Family Owned Business Affected by Riots and Covid","id":"family-owned-business-effected-by-riots-and-covid","longDesc":"Emily's Eatery was vandalized, glass smashed, looted/robbed.

Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we had to temporarily close our doors for two months and in doing so we took a big loss in income. Just a week ago, our doors were allowed to open once again, and to prepare for the re-opening of our shop, we took on a significant amount of debt to bring merchandise to fill our shelves.Over $20,000 worth of products and property was stolen or damaged.

We understand that these are difficult times that we as a community are living through and we are eternally grateful for all the love and support. The funds will go to pay off debts, pay for property damages and help us get started once again.

Look good, feel good!\n\n\nMy dad has dedicated his years in the industry to running a successful small business while employing and providing stable income for his employees (special shout out to Joe Crane, who has been by his side for over 30 years!). \n\n\nAlong with other small businesses in San Francisco, West Coast Leather has been forced to shut their doors due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19).  WCL's storefront sits in Union Square, the historic heart of San Francisco, where rent and real estate is already extremely costly. Despite being closed to the public, rent payments are still due, over $10,000 per month. In December 2019, WCL lost their five year lease after a new commercial landlord took over their building.  My dad was forced to find a new store during peak Christmas season. The $25,000 down payment on the store’s new lease along with over $20,000 in moving expenses have depleted West Coast Leather’s entire emergency savings.The combined expenses of moving stores and being forced to close due to COVID-19 are absolutely devastating. My dad was so excited to be successful in this beautiful new storefront and start 2020 strong for his customers, colleagues and family. Instead, he is now facing over $30,000 of rent, with no incoming sales, as all non-essential businesses are closed through May. With West Coast Leather’s doors closed to the public, we are terrified of the prospect that we will close our doors for good.  It’s heartbreaking that due to this global pandemic, my dad may lose the livelihood he has dedicated his life to for over 30 years.\n\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, everything helps, and thank you so much for taking time out of your day to hear our story.\n\n\nhttps://www.westcoastleather.com/\n","desc":"\nWhen you create a business, you sign up to deal with the challenges that come ","region":"CA","shared_count":1020,"campaign_state":"active","user":"Michelle Pas","index":34},{"source":"gfm","image":"https://images.gofundme.com/ZfpONWBCPh1mIjFBjZNMTSY1kDY=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48455742_1591025631729829_r.jpeg","hearts":130,"launched":"2020-06-01T10:35:47-05:00","current":8208,"deactivated":false,"donations":133,"donations_enabled":true,"goal":5000,"name":"Miami Fusion Cafe Riot Recovery","id":"miami-fusion-cafe-riot-recovery","longDesc":"You see this little restaurant right here!

He was at risk of losing his life, freedom and being taken away from his four daughters, family and beloved community. For two years, Louis continued to proclaim his innocence and fought to get his charges dropped, to no avail. During this traumatic time, Louis lost his car, his lawn care business, and his housing, as a result of his pending charges.Just weeks before his trial, a local couple, Sarah and Dan Woodcock, heard his story and felt compelled to get involved. Sarah and Dan worked with local Black Lives Matter (BLM) leaders, including Nekima Levy Pounds and Chauntyll Allen and allies to rally the community to help fight Louis’ bogus charges. After a concerted effort, all of Louis’s charges were miraculously dismissed. In the aftermath of his charges being dropped, Louis approached Sarah and Dan about launching a food truck business. That idea spawned a partnership that resulted in the creation of Trio plant-based , a brick and mortar restaurant that serves healthy, delicious vegan food, located in Minneapolis. Trio was launched over a year ago through personal contributions of the owners, the support of our local community, and advocates and allies for racial justice from around the nation. In keeping with its focus on racial equity and justice, Trio has created numerous job opportunities, including for people of color and provide their employees with a living wage.A few months ago, Louis' business partners, Sarah and Dan, decided to close Trio but Louis was not ready to give up on his dream. During the first several months of business, Sarah, Dan and Louis encountered typical business challenges along with issues of anti-blackness, a component of racism that many don't talk about. Anti-blackness is baked into the fibers of systemic racism so pervasive that it's almost invisible. Sarah, Dan and Louis were not adequately prepared to deal with the anti-blackness when it became visible. And sadly, it did during the growing phase of Trio which put a strain on their working relationships. Those relationships have been adversely affected but not completely severed. These types of challenges are to be expected when three people from different racial backgrounds join forces to create one entity. Nevertheless, anti-blackness is a seriously oppressive type of behavior.  And although this may be perceived as a failure it really is a set up for greater. Sarah, Dan and Louis were not able to resolve their challenges so Sarah and Dan made the decision to step back from Trio and transfer full ownership to Louis. The transfer of  ownership to Louis means that he operates the only 100% Black-owned vegan restaurant in the state of Minnesota. This is a reason to celebrate. Louis has an incredible opportunity to ensure the growth and sustainability of Trio, but he urgently needs our help.Owning a restaurant is already a challenging endeavor. However, in addition to the traditional challenges, Louis has had to contend with being an African American man who has had contact with the criminal justice system in a state that has some of the worst racial disparities in the nation between Blacks and Whites. This includes disparities in lending practices by the major banks. As a result, Louis will need the support of our entire community to ensure that Trio will operate successfully for many years to come.If you believe in racial, restorative and economic justice we need you to believe in Louis and Trio now more than ever. To get Trio to a place of strong financial positioning and stability, Louis needs to raise a total of $150,000 within the next 60 days, with an urgent need of $30,000 in the first 30 days of this campaign. We can do it! It must be done. So, let’s do it! The money raised will be used for paying off business debts, employee salaries, professional development fees (so Louis can excel as a leader), and operational expenses. The funds will provide a financial cushion, as Trio prepares to become one of the most successful black owned businesses in the state of Minnesota. Please give what you can frequently and consistently throughout the campaign. All funds will go directly to support Trio . Feel free to share this campaign with your family, friends and colleagues. Thanks in advance for your love and support. We appreciate your contributions. Now let’s make it happen. *Please keep in mind that each donation has a 2.9% transaction fee + a $0.30 fee. We suggest you add that back into your donation so Trio receives your full donation. *Please share this campaign and feel free to use the hashtags below.

My mother Emma has been in business for 20 years and has dedicated her life to serving her customers. She migrated from Haiti as a teenager and has since found her home in the Rochester community that she very much loves. In her 20 years, she has provided essential clothing and accessories items at a price that those poverty stricken in the community can afford. In her beginning days, her business location was simply a folding table in the grass on West Avenue where she sold items out of her van. Her staple items such as her 3 for $10 t shirts and 2 for $25 jeans have been at the same price for years to ensure her long time customers can always afford to shop for their families. She is known for always helping the community and never hesitates to help those around her. Due to falling on hard times during the covid 19 pandemic and before, there was unfortunately no business insurance. So she will not be collecting any payment for more than half her inventory that was lost and the damage to her storefront. I am hoping that as a community we can help a small business owner to rebuild stronger than before. She is uncertain if she will be able to continue at the same location but wants to rebuild something better. Although her business is currently lost, she is remaining strong knowing that her misfortune does not amount to the loss of a life. We stand in solidarity with the protesters peacefully protesting the murder of George Floyd. Though the store was destroyed during a night of riots, looting and violence we are still able to understand the anger and rage those genuinely protesting for change.

While we are tired, many of us also hear the calls to action of this moment and want to do what we can to address the injustice experienced by George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many more. As we navigate this time, I encourage everyone to VALUE LIVES FIRST - please prioritize donating to bail out funds, legal defense funds, social justice funds and other organizations continuing the daily fight to end structural racism rooted in white supremacy. A list of priority organizations to donate to is provided below.If you are able to do more, there are other steps we can take to support the long-term economic viability of the black community in our city.  While the majority of black-owned businesses were unharmed during the most recent protests, a few received superficial damages to their store fronts, including broken glass and graffiti. Our black business community is already suffering financially as a result of COVID-19 closures and they run the risk of long-term hardships or permanent closure.  Repair costs can be significant— as a point of reference, it costs about $1,400 to replace a single piece of plate glass and insurance deductibles are often even more expensive for business owners. With this in mind, we know that small amounts will go a long way for our vital small businesses during this time. As always, I believe in the resiliency of the black community here, both in the face of racist tyranny and economic uncertainty, however it is up to us to support our own. Please join me in raising funds to be used as small grants of between $100 - $500 (depending on how much is raised) to help reimburse expenses  incurred by Black-owned businesses to repair damage caused by protests. The plan is for funds to be distributed as shown below starting June 1, 2020.“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.It is our duty to win.We must love each other and support each other.We have nothing to lose but our chains.”Assata ShakurWith Love,Elisse *If you are interested in co-sponsoring this fundraising effort, helping to distribute funds and/or helping with business outreach etc. please let me know.Reimbursable costsGlass repair and replacementGraffiti abatement (ex. cleaning supplies, painting supplies, graffiti coating replacement)Facade and sidewalk cleaning  (ex. cleaning supplies, painting supplies, graffiti coating replacement costs, trash removal)Who is EligibleGround floor black owned businesses in Oakland damaged during the May 28-31st protestsHow the Funds will be DisbursedA Google forms application will be distributed via social media and other organizations in Oakland that support black businesses.

We're organizing this GoFundMe to support small businesses that were affected yesterday. \n\n\nCommunity members: please donate as much as you can and share this link with everyone you know.\n\n\nDowntown small business owners: please fill out the following google form and we'll reach out to you once the funds start coming in.\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduLq-gMjnyq_3CY3rPlrDVPTDgQbzNmGlCm234AY5p5x-I_w/viewform?usp=pp_url\n\n\nThis is set up for an initial $20,000 goal but please continue to donate after the goal is reached to help as many small businesses as possible. The plan is to start distributing the funds as early as the second week of June depending on how this GoFundMe performs. The funds will be distributed in a form of cash, checks, or Venmo payments to the business owners on a first come first serve basis (we'll monitor the google form for that). Please note that the amount distributed will be based on the type of damage that has occurred to the business, when the form was submitted, and the size of the business -smaller businesses will have more priority. Black and minority-owned businesses will also have priority. Please reach out if you have any questions.\n\n\nThis next part represents our own opinions, so please don't let it affect your willingness to donate: this fund in no way was set up to take away from the protests happening over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people, which are the number one priority. We’re proud of those who raised and continue to raise their voice for the black community.  Also, please keep in mind that what happened last night after the protests and early this morning doesn't represent the victims of systematic racism and discrimination all around the country and doesn’t align with the goals of the protests organized. We can't let the actions of a few take away from the overwhelming peaceful calls for change and justice. \n\n\nThe issue of racism is not a left-or-right-winged conversation. It’s something that is engrained within our society on all levels which means we all play a part in the issue and we all can also play a part in the change. Here are some funds, organizations, and resources that support the black community and specifically George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery (we’ll keep updating the list as we find others):\n\n\nhttps://t.co/lteSFSzU2d \n\n\nhttps://t.co/c0m5z7EzdA \n\n\nhttp://www.raleighapexnaacp.org/index.php\n\n\nhttps://blacklivesmatter.com/\n\n\nhttps://antiracismforbegginers.com/bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES\n\n\nStay safe and stay woke. #Justice4GeorgeFloyd #BLM\n","desc":"\nOur beloved downtown Raleigh took a beating last night and it seems that small busin","region":"NC","shared_count":281,"campaign_state":"active","user":"Yusuf Ali","index":59},{"source":"gfm","image":"https://images.gofundme.com/7GKyBT_Zbc79wvy_gPqIiMSQ21I=/640x480/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/48437932_1590957847672945_r.jpeg","hearts":108,"launched":"2020-05-31T16:05:27-05:00","current":6268,"deactivated":false,"donations":108,"donations_enabled":true,"goal":5000,"name":"California Street Cannabis Destruction","id":"california-street-cannabis-destruction","longDesc":"\nOn Saturday, May 30th, our beloved California   Street Cannabis Dispensary was senselessly looted.

Drakari has worked through so many obstacles to become a young, BLACK entrepreneur. We are so proud of what he has accomplished and know that with your support, he can continue being a leader in the community. \n\n\nWe know there are small businesses across the country being affected by everything going on, but if you are in Dra's network, know him personally, or just want to support a small business during these difficult times, we know he would appreciate it immensely. In the event that the insurance provider  is able to cover all costs, these funds will be donated to the Communities United Against Police Brutality Fund.\n\n\nLet's remember we need to be the change
