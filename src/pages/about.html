    <h1>Why this exists</h1>

    <p>In the wake of a disaster, many charitable camapaigns spring up on GoFundMe. Some go viral and exceed their goals by a large margin. Others may raise a bit from friends but are mostly forgotten.</p>

    <p>During the spring of 2020, looting across the USA took everything from some people and small business owners. This site exists to help them in a small way, and bring attention to the charitable campaigns that need some extra visibility to reach their goals.</p>

    <p>It by no means solves the larger problems around the situation, but I hope this can help bring some good to people who are suffering.</p>

    <h1>How to help</h1>

    <p>Donate to one of the causes here! All links go directly to GoFundMe. I get no percentage or any other consideration.</p>

    <p>If you know of a GoFundMe campaign that should be listed here, you can click the "Add" link at the top and submit it. I'm currently processing those submissions manually myself, so it may take a while but I try to get to them within a day.</p>
